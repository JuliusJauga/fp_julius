The following changes were made to grammar:
    1. Commands were added to the grammar.
    2. New commands added:
        1. <route_add_stop> :: "route-add-stop " <name> <stop>          (Added for better control of state transitions)
        2. <route_remove_stop> :: "route-remove-stop " <name> <stop>    (Added for better control of state transitions)
        3. <routes_from_stop> :: "routes-from-stop " <stop>             (Added for additional functionality)
    3. Changes to command parameters:
        1. list-add <list> <route>          - - >   <list_add> ::= "list-add " <name> <route>     (Changed for easier use in Tree structure, doesn't make sense to specify the whole list for adding a route)
        2. list-get <list> <name>           - - >   <list_get> ::= "list-get " <name>             (Changed to instead return a list with that name)
        3. list-remove <list> <name>        - - >   <list_remove> ::= "list-remove " <name>       (Changed to instead remove the whole list)
        4. route-get <route> <name>         - - >   <route_get> ::= "route-get " <name>           (Change to return route by name, because this makes more sense in state transition work flow)
        5. route-remove <route> <stop_name> - - >   <route_remove> ::= "route-remove " <name>     (Changed for easier usage, instead finds a route by that name and removes it)
    4. Changes to name in BNF.                              (This change was added so that parser composing could be demonstrated)
        1. A name can be one of three types of names.
        2. <string_name> is made of letters and numbers.
        3. <number_name> is a name made of digits.
        4. <word_name> is a name made of different words.
    5. Added components.    (Main building blocks for different types of names)
        1. <letter>     
        2. <digit>      
        3. <word>       
        4. <number>   

    6. Added components.    (Main building blocks for Lab3)
        1. <command>
        2. <compound_query>
        3. <commands_list>
        4. <load_commands>
        5. <save_commands>
